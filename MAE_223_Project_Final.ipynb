    "At this moment in history, mankind is on a precipice as it prepares to swim away from the shores of the cosmic ocean. In order to embark on this journey, we must be prepared to face the plethora of dangers that comes with living in space for an extended period of time - one in particular being the lack of gravity and its effect on the human body. Without the force of gravity acting on us, our bodies slowly deteriorate through decreasing bone density and muscle mass. For short time spans on the order of a year, this is a recoverable condition - however, beyond that, the effects begin to become more and more detrimental. If we are to begin thinking seriously about sending people to places beyond the moon or Mars, a viable method must be developed to simulate gravity for astronauts. One of the oldest and most-often considered methods is to use an enclosed, symmetric environment and allow it to rotate along a central axis to create a *rotogravic environment* on the interior - one that feigns a gravitational force via an individual's inertia in an inertial reference frame, or *centrifugal force*.\n",

    "\n",
    "The original objective set out to be accomplished would seen the formulation of an active controller which would work to control the position of \"ballast\" masses located on the circumference of the station in order to balance out any shifts in mass due to the aforementioned motion of people, equipment, etc. within the station, as shown in Figure 1 below.\n",

Three rotations are required in order to orient to the body-fixed axes, and the order of rotation will certainly affect the interpretations of the results. As is generally well-known, two separate rotations performed around X then Y are not necessarily equal to the same rotations performed about Y then X axes. Therefore, it is necessary to pay close attention to which generalized coordinate revolves the reference frame about which axis.\n",

This result would be expected in a 'ZYX' transformation since the orientation of the station about its axis of symmetry should not affect the dynamics of the system (assuming symmetry of mass distribution as well). However, upon changing the rotation transformation style to something such as 'XYZ', we find that the system is *still not a function of $q_1$*, despite the fact that $q_1$ should now correspong to rotation about the inertial X axis.\n",

    "The initial objective of this project proved to be far loftier than initially expected, and unfortunately only a portion of the objectives were obtained. An analogous system consisting of multiple point masses, some of which are prescribed motion in time, was formed and equations of motion derived using Kane's Method, followed by simulating, plotting the state vectors through time, and visualizing the motion using 3D shapes. Various body transformation methods were explored to determine the most suitable choice of transformations to intuit the state of the system from the state vectors alone. A controller design was attempted but ultimately was not completed due to a seemingly erroneous linearization of the state space. Though incomplete, we can still claim with confidence that the non-linear equations of motion derived using Kane's Method accurately described the motion of the system as we would expect it to behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future work should strive to *properly* linearize the system, or alternatively, attempt to design a controller around a non-linear plant. Following that, the interaction between the point masses and the station can be modeled to account for action/reactions such as those that take place as a human walks along a surface. Further work could be done to account for various external forces such as solar wind, gravitational gradients acting radially outward from any nearby cellestial bodies, and aerodynamic drag (if the station were assumed to be in low-Earth Orbit)."
